00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.040
There huddled love

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.500
and fostered a token monster

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.360
I have to love it

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.880
From "Didn't work" to "I hesitated"

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640
Why is it always me?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.440
Thinking like that, bath time went by in a blink

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.800
All were beautiful but I hated them all

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.400
No matter how hard I try, I'm an ordinary guy

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.240
My whole life goes bibbidi-bobbi-boo

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
I'm uttering something helpless in a daydream

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.080
I'm gonna pop one last question of the century

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.280
What if she hates it?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.040
…And then some, I'm thinking

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.720
What if she hates it?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.400
…And then some, I'm thinking

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.440
Did she laugh?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.240
Did love rush here…?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880
I must love it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.600
From "Didn't work" to "I was scared"

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.360
Why is it always you?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.920
Thinking like that, I'm tired of injury time

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.600
I hated them all, I hated them all

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.320
Not a big deal; it's like that in most cases

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920
This time again, are we ending at my turn?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.720
Talking about stability, relationship is somehow

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.200
ambiguous and uncool, but I'm so into you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.600
But you'll never know

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.240
Probably we're still short of something

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.760
Your restless emotions

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.440
Welcome to spill them out, this and that

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.880
I'm absolutely mad about you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.560
I'm addicted to you, my universe

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.880
There's nothing I can do, so unwillingly enough

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.080
let's escape to some unknown star

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.800
No matter how hard I try, I'm an ordinary guy

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.520
My whole life goes bibbidi-bobbi-boo

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
I'm uttering something helpless in a daydream

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
I'm gonna pop one last question of the century

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.640
What if she hates it?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.560
…And then some, I'm thinking about

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.120
What if she hates it?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.120
…And then some, I'm thinking

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880
Rain fell; waiting for the night to fall

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.400
she turned into a wind

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.920
What is happiness?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.840
I have no clue to difficult things!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Rain fell; waiting for the night to fall

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.360
she turned into a star

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.960
What is happiness?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960
I no longer have a clue about you!

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.480
What if she hates it?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.120
…And then some, I'm thinking

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.240
What if she hates it?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.200
…And then some, I'm thinking
