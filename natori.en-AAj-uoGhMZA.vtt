00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:23.908
From the tip of my finger held up straight,

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:28.633
I can see it glittering.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:33.461
From the back of my open mouth,

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:38.210
I can see Mars today, as always.

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:42.835
I want to have a peaceful life.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:43.775
A rest.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.671
Ah, please understand.

00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:50.291
Rendezvous to Mars.

00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.122
Ordinary days. Ordinary sympathy.

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:57.120
All I want to see is a playful storm.

00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:59.840
Rendezvous to Mars.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.680
There’s no need for a lantern nor a mirror.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.394
If only my misery were the reflection of the moon.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.118
From the tip of the pen held up straight,

00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:35.851
I can see my coreless self.

00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:40.520
Even in a deadly silent night,

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:45.456
orchid petals stand out nicely.

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:49.790
Let me sleep deeply.

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:50.932
A rest.

00:01:52.317 --> 00:01:53.865
Caress me gently.

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:57.755
Rendezvous on Mars.

00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:00.306
Days of inertia. Ideal is the gravity.

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:04.422
All I want to see is what’s inside of you.

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.044
Rendezvous to myself.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:09.852
There’s no need for music nor drugs.

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:17.623
If only my values were the reflexes of the brain.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:38.505
From the tip of the tail held up straight,

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:43.263
I can see the thread-like crescent moon in a haze.

00:02:47.948 --> 00:02:48.456
A rest.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.518
Ah, it’s so frustrating.

00:02:54.872 --> 00:02:57.321
Rendezvous to Mars.

00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:59.750
Days of inertia. Day after day of reason.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.776
All you’re missing is time and leeway.

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:06.517
Rendezvous to Mars.

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:09.282
There’s no need for bullets nor fireworks there.

00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:13.463
I wish the land on Mars were the same as chocolate.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.594
Rendezvous to Mars.

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:18.954
Good bye to that gravity of the earth.

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:22.929
All I’m looking at is the light of words.

00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.699
Rendezvous to Mars.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.469
There’s no need for a lantern nor a mirror.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:36.000
If only my misery were the reflection of the moon.
